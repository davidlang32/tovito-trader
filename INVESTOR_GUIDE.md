## Understanding Your Dashboard

When you log in, you'll see your personal investment dashboard with several key sections:

### Portfolio Overview

| Metric | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| **Portfolio Value** | The current dollar value of your investment |
| **Current Shares** | How many shares of the fund you own |
| **Total Return ($)** | How much you've gained or lost in dollars |
| **Total Return (%)** | Your gain or loss as a percentage |
| **Portfolio Share** | Your ownership percentage of the total fund |

### NAV Per Share

The **Net Asset Value (NAV) per share** is the price of one share of the fund. It's calculated daily after the market closes:

```
NAV = Total Portfolio Value / Total Shares Outstanding
```

When you contribute money, you receive shares at the current NAV.
When you withdraw money, you redeem shares at the current NAV.

### Fund Performance

| Period | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Daily** | Change from yesterday |
| **Month-to-Date (MTD)** | Change since the 1st of this month |
| **Year-to-Date (YTD)** | Change since January 1st |
| **Since Inception** | Total return since the fund started |

## Contributions

### How to Make a Contribution

1. Transfer funds to the fund's brokerage account
2. Notify the fund administrator of the transfer
3. Once funds clear, the administrator will process your contribution
4. New shares will be issued at that day's NAV

### How Shares Are Calculated

```
New Shares = Contribution Amount / Current NAV
```

**Example:**
- You contribute $5,000
- Current NAV is $1.15 per share
- You receive: $5,000 / $1.15 = 4,347.83 shares

---

## Withdrawals

### How to Request a Withdrawal

1. Contact the fund administrator with your withdrawal request
2. Specify the amount you wish to withdraw
3. The administrator will process your request
4. Funds will be transferred after tax withholding

### Understanding Tax Withholding

When you withdraw, you may have **realized gains** that are subject to tax. The fund automatically withholds estimated taxes.

**How it works:**

1. **Shares Redeemed:** Your withdrawal amount / Current NAV
2. **Cost Basis:** The original value of those shares
3. **Realized Gain:** Current value minus cost basis
4. **Tax Withheld:** 37% of the realized gain (federal rate)
5. **Net Proceeds:** Withdrawal amount minus tax withheld

**Example:**
- You withdraw $5,000
- Cost basis of those shares: $4,500
- Realized gain: $500
- Tax withheld (37%): $185
- You receive: $4,815

### Withdrawal Estimate

Before confirming a withdrawal, you'll see an estimate showing:
- Requested amount
- Estimated realized gain
- Estimated tax
- Net proceeds you'll receive

## Your Transaction History

The **Recent Transactions** section shows your activity:

| Transaction Type | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| **Contribution** | Money you added to the fund |
| **Withdrawal** | Money you took out of the fund |
| **Tax Withholding** | Taxes withheld on realized gains |

Each transaction shows:
- Date
- Amount
- Shares added or redeemed
- NAV at the time

| **Net Investment** | Total contributions minus total withdrawals |
| **Initial Capital** | Your first contribution amount |
| **Current Shares** | Total shares you own |
| **Investor ID** | Your unique account identifier |

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How often is my portfolio value updated?

The portfolio value is updated daily after the market closes (around 4:00 PM ET). Weekend and holiday values remain unchanged until the next market day.

### Why did my share count change?

Your share count only changes when you:
- Make a contribution (shares increase)
- Make a withdrawal (shares decrease)

Daily market movements change the **value** of your shares, not the **number** of shares.

### How is my return calculated?

```
Total Return = Current Value - Net Investment
Return % = (Total Return / Net Investment) × 100
```

### What is the tax rate used for withholding?

The fund withholds at the highest federal marginal rate (currently 37%) to ensure sufficient taxes are set aside. Your actual tax liability may differ based on your personal tax situation.

### Can I see historical performance?

Yes! The Fund Performance section shows returns for various time periods. Contact the administrator for detailed historical reports.

### How do I get my monthly statement?

Monthly statements are emailed to you by the 5th of each month. You can also request statements from the fund administrator.
