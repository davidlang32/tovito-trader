## 💡 KEY FEATURES

### **Tax Calculation Example:**

**Investor Position:**
- Net investment: $15,000 (cost basis)
- Current value: $17,500
- Unrealized gain: $2,500

**They want to withdraw $8,000:**

```
Proportion: $8,000 ÷ $17,500 = 45.71%
Realized gain: $2,500 × 45.71% = $1,142.86
Tax (37%): $1,142.86 × 37% = $422.86
Net proceeds: $8,000 - $422.86 = $7,577.14

Investor receives: $7,577.14
Tax withheld: $422.86
```

**All calculated automatically!** ✅
